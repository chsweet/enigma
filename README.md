# Enigma

## Self Evaluation
### Overall I have meet expectations: Throughout the project every method is tested and the tests were written prior to writing the code. The command line interfaces are successfully implemented for both encrypt and decrypt methods. Most classes bundle methods to get a desired output. There is more refactoring that can be done in the Enigma class to dry the code out more. Throughout the code ruby conventions were followed.
